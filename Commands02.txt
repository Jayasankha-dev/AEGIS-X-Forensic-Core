🛡️ Browser Security Audit Guide: Hunting Hidden Background Connections

This guide explains how to identify and terminate unauthorized background services (Service Workers) that may be leaking data or tracking your activity 
without your consent.

1. The Entry Point: Notifications
URL: chrome://settings/content/notifications

Purpose: Malicious sites often trick users into clicking "Allow" on a notification pop-up. This is the "hook" they use to install a Service Worker.

What to do: Look at the "Allowed to send notifications" list. If you see sites you don't recognize (especially shopping, betting, or random string sites), 
remove them immediately.

2. The Engine: Service Worker Internals
URL: chrome://serviceworker-internals/

Purpose: This page lists every background script currently registered in your browser. Service Workers can run even if the website's tab is closed.

What to check: * Scope: Look for URLs that don't belong to trusted services like Google, YouTube, or your installed extensions.

Registration Count: A typical user has 5-15. If you see 50+, your browser is likely being used for data harvesting or ad-fraud.

The Fix: Use the "Unregister" button for suspicious entries, or use the Console script to wipe them all at once.

3. The Evidence: Network Export
URL: chrome://net-export/

Purpose: This is a forensic tool that captures every single packet of data entering or leaving the browser.

How to use: 1. Click "Start Logging to Disk".
2. Browse for a few minutes.
3. Stop logging and upload the .json file to a tool like NetLog Viewer.

What we look for: We search for "Established" connections to foreign IP addresses (like the Alibaba/Taobao IPs we found) 
that occur while you aren't even visiting those sites.

🚀 Quick Cleanup Command (For Developers)
To instantly terminate all registered background workers, open the Console (F12) on any standard website and run:

JavaScript
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
    for(let registration of registrations) {
        registration.unregister();
        console.log('Terminated:', registration.scope);
    }
    console.log('Audit Complete: All background services cleared.');
});

💡 Summary for the User
If your computer feels slow or you see suspicious network activity in PowerShell, it is often not a "virus" in the traditional sense, 
but a Service Worker Hijack. By auditing these three Chrome internal pages, you can regain 100% control over your data privacy.
