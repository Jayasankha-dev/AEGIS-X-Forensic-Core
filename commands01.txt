🛡️ Advanced Forensic Toolkit (Set #02)
11. Hidden SMB Share Audit
Command: Get-SmbShare

Description: Checks for shared folders on your network.

Objective: Attackers often create "Hidden Shares" (like C$) to move files between machines on the same Wi-Fi.

12. Digital Signature Verification (System File Hijacking)
Command: Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows\System32\*.exe | Get-AuthenticodeSignature | Where-Object { $_.Status -ne "Valid" }

Description: Scans core Windows files to see if their digital signature is broken.

Objective: Detects if a hacker has replaced a real Windows file (like taskmgr.exe) with a fake, malicious one.

13. WMI Event Consumer Hunt (The "Ghost" Persistence)
Command: Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\subscription -Class __EventConsumer

Description: Scans for WMI scripts that run without a process.

Objective: This is the most "high-level" way hackers hide. The malware runs inside Windows Management Instrumentation, making it invisible to the Task Manager.

14. DLL Injection & Loaded Module Audit
Command: Get-Process | ForEach-Object { $_.Modules } | Where-Object { $_.FileName -like "*AppData*" -or $_.FileName -like "*Temp*" }

Description: Lists every DLL file currently loaded into your RAM from suspicious folders.

Objective: Detects "DLL Injection," where a virus hides inside a legitimate program like Chrome or Notepad.

15. Clipboard & Keylogger Buffer Check
Command: Get-Clipboard (or monitoring RawInput via API)

Description: Checks what is currently sitting in the system clipboard.

Objective: Some malware monitors the clipboard to steal passwords when you copy-paste them from a manager.

16. Power-Shell Execution Policy Audit
Command: Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

Description: Shows if the security restrictions for scripts have been lowered.

Objective: If LocalMachine is set to Unrestricted, it means a hacker has disabled your script security.

17. ARP Table Inspection (Man-in-the-Middle check)
Command: arp -a

Description: Shows the physical addresses (MAC) of devices you are talking to.

Objective: Detects if someone on your Wi-Fi is intercepting your traffic (ARP Spoofing).

18. Hidden User Group Membership
Command: Get-WmiObject Win32_GroupUser | Where-Object { $_.GroupComponent -match "Administrators" }

Description: A deeper look at group memberships that might not show up in the standard UI.

Objective: To ensure the "Anonymous" account or other hidden SIDs aren't nested inside other groups.

19. Large File & Sparse File Discovery
Command: Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 500MB }

Description: Finds unusually large files created recently.

Objective: Locates "Data Staging" areas where a hacker has zipped up your photos/docs before uploading them.

20. Firewall Rule Audit (Unauthorized Holes)
Command: Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object { $_.Enabled -eq "True" -and $_.Direction -eq "Inbound" } | Select-Object DisplayName, Profile, Action

Description: Lists every rule that allows outside traffic into your PC.

Objective: To see if a program has "punched a hole" in your firewall to allow remote control.

🚨 Final Pro-Tip for your Report:
If you find a suspicious file (like a .ps1 or .exe), you can get its Hash to check it against global databases like VirusTotal:
Get-FileHash -Path "C:\Path\To\SuspiciousFile.exe" -Algorithm SHA256
