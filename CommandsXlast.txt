🛡️ The "Centennial" Audit & Recovery (Set #06: Steps 51-60)
51. Master File Table (MFT) & USN Journal Analysis
Command: fsutil usn readjournal C: csv
Description: Reads the low-level "Journal" of every single file change ever made on the disk.
Objective: Even if a hacker deletes a file and clears the Event Logs, the USN Journal (built into the NTFS file system) keeps a record of the deletion. This is the ultimate "History" of the hard drive.

52. Nuclear Process Termination (Suspension First)
Command: Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 50 } | ForEach-Object { $_.Suspend() }
Description: Instead of killing a process (which might trigger a "Watchdog" to restart it), this Freezes the process in RAM.
Objective: Stops the virus from acting without letting it know it's being attacked. You can then analyze its memory while it's "frozen."

53. Removing "Image File Execution Options" (The Silent Hijack)
Command: Get-ChildItem "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options"
Description: Checks if a hacker has redirected common apps.
Objective: Hackers use this so that when you try to open taskmgr.exe or regedit.exe, it actually opens their virus instead. Delete any key here that matches a system app.

54. Total Network Stack Purge (The 2100 Standard)
Command: ```powershell
netsh branchcache reset; netsh int ipv6 reset; netsh advfirewall reset; nbtstat -R; nbtstat -RR

**Description:** Resets every communication protocol in the OS.
**Objective:** Clears hidden "Static Routes" and "DNS Poisoning" that hackers use to redirect your traffic even after a reboot.

### 55. WMI Repository Repair (Removing the "Ghost in the Machine")
**Command:** `winmgmt /salvagerepository`
**Description:** Verifies and repairs the WMI database.
**Objective:** If a hacker has hidden "Permanent Event Consumers" (Ghost malware) in WMI, this command rebuilds the database to its clean state.

### 56. Deep Registry "Run" Cleanup (The Kill-Switch)
**Command:** ```powershell
Remove-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Description: Wipes EVERY startup item.
Objective: It’s better to manually re-enable what you need (Chrome, Spotify) than to let one hidden malware Run key survive.

57. The "Immutability" Lock (Protecting System32)
Command: ```powershell
icacls "C:\Windows\System32" /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"; icacls "C:\Windows\System32" /grant:r "Everyone":(RX)

**Description:** Resets permissions of System32 to "Read & Execute" only.
**Objective:** Prevents any user (even an Admin or a Hacker) from writing new malicious files into the most sensitive part of Windows.

### 58. Dispatching the "Shadow Admin" (Full Deletion)
**Command:** ```powershell
net user Anonymous /delete; Remove-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "Anonymous"
Description: Forcefully deletes the user account and strips its privileges.
Objective: Complete removal of the attacker's "Home Base" in your system.

59. Clearing the "Prefetch & Temp" Biohazard Zones
Command: ```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Windows\Temp*", "C:\Windows\Prefetch*", "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Temp*" -Recurse -Force

**Description:** Wipes the three main places where malware hides its temporary "Payloads."
**Objective:** Removes the physical tracks of the virus.

### 60. Final Integrity Seal (DISM Health Restore)
**Command:** `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`
**Description:** Connects to Microsoft's servers to download "Perfect" copies of any corrupted system files.
**Objective:** This is the ultimate "Fix Everything" button. It replaces any file the hacker touched with a 100% original version.

## 🛠️ The 2100 Maintenance Plan (For the User)

To keep this machine running perfectly until the next century, follow this **Post-Audit Protocol**:

1.  **Run Step 60** once every 6 months.
2.  **Run Step 54** whenever the internet feels "laggy."
3.  **Check Step 07** (from Set 1) weekly to ensure no new users appeared.
